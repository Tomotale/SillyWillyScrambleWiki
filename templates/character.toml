# Descriptions support linking to other moves using the
# macro %ref(<move name>, <input string>, <button>). For
# example, %ref(Chrono Shift, 214K, k) will link to the
# Chrono Shift move and display as "214K" in the description.
# Descriptions also support coloring text according to
# button with %btn(<button>, <text>). For example, %btn(k, K)
# will display as "K" in the associated color (blue for Kick).
# You can also use raw HTML to create lists, make text bold or
# italic, and so on.
