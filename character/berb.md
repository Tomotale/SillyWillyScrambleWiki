# Berbdabee
###### ([Back to Home](../README.md))

# Overview
Berb controls the stage through strategic placement of Rift Points, to which he can teleport himself or the opponent
to with `214P` or `236S`. With his ability to manipulate time and reposition on a whim, Berd can excellently control
the flow of the match (quite literally) to his favor.

# Command Normals
### Taunt
Advances the in-game timer by 3 seconds.

# Special Attacks
### Time Rift
`214P`<br>
Berb summons a Rift Point to which he can teleport later. Up to three teleport points can be placed at a time,
overriding the oldest point first.

### Chrono Shift
`214K`<br>
Berb teleports to the most recent Rift Point. Pressing `K` again during the animation will prolong the teleport,
instead moving to the next most recent point, or if repeated, the oldest point.

### Distortion
`236S`<br>
Berd attacks the opponent, teleporting the opponent to the most recent Rift Point. Pressing `S` again will prolong
the teleport, instead moving to the next most recent point, or if repeated, the oldest point.

### Clockwork
`214S`<br>
Gears pop out of Berb's robotic arm as he performs a large downward swing that hits overhead. Plays a large gong sound
on hit, sending the opponent into stagger, or Guard Crush on block.

### Tempo Synchronization 
`236H`<br>
Berd sends a version of him from an alternate timeline to assist in attacking the opponent, launching them into the 
air on hit.

# Super Attacks
### Chrono Statis
`632146K`<br>
A powerful move that freezes time, locking the opponent in place. Although it has slow startup, it hits anywhere on
the screen and cannot be evaded using invulnerability frames. The opponent is frozen for 2 seconds, allowing Berb an
opportunity to set up a high-power combo. If the opponent was hit while frozen, they will be launched when time 
unfreezes.

### Accent Acceleration
`214214H`<br>
Increases the rate of which the in-game timer and mechanic timers advance by 15%

### Time Fault
`214236P`<br>
Berd jumps backwards and suddenly appears far forwards. If Berd crosses up the opponent, they are hit and a Rift Point
is created (if there are not already 3 points active)
