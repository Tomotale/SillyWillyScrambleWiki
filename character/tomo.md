# Tomotale
###### ([Back to Home](../README.md))

# Overview
Weilding a glaive and tome, Tomo focuses on keeping the opponent at a safe distance, allowing him to
then close the gap and convert into full combos up close.

# Mechanics
## Mana
Mana is a resource that Tomo spends to perform his specials. Upon being hit, he loses Mana equal to the HP
damage that he takes. He cannot use specials that cost more Mana then he has. Upon hitting 0 Mana, enter
Stagger state, then regain all Mana.

## Stagger State
When Tomo's mana is exhausted, he automatically enters Stagger State. During this state, Tomo is left **helpless
and vulnerable**â€”he cannot input any commands, he takes **twice** as much damage as normal, and the following
hit triggers an **automatic counter hit**. Stagger State ends after a couple seconds or after the current combo
finishes.

# Command Normals
### Magia Wall
`6S`<br>
Tomo uses his tome to quickly summon a wall of magic that not only reflects any incoming projectiles, but also
can gatling into itself on hit.

# Special Attacks

> [!WARNING]
> These special attacks might not have sufficient combo potential in implementation, needs revision.

### Ignis Rush
`236S/H` (Hold OK)<br>
A chargable fire-based projectile that travels along a set path, exploding into a firery vortex which launches the
opponent up into the air.

* `236S`<br> **S Ignis Rush** 
  The projectile travels along the ground. The explosion triggers after a certain amount of distance or upon hitting the
  opponent.
* `236H`<br> **H Ignis Rush**
  The projectile travels diagonally into the air. The explosion no longer triggers automatically, only when
  hitting the opponent.

### Ventus Thrust
`214S/H`<br>
Tomo summons blades of wind that can be used to push the opponent.

* `214S`<br> **S Ventus Thrust** 
  Summons blades of wind from the opposite side of the screen, pushing the opponent towards Tomo.
  Can catch opponents who have a habit of backdashing. Pressing `S` again makes Tomo perform a forward thrust with his 
  spear, sending the opponent into the winds.
* `214H`<br> **H Ventus Thrust**
  Summons blades directly in front of Tomo, sending the opponent away. Pressing `H` again causes
  the blades to switch direction to move diagonally.

### Renovare
`22P/K` (Hold OK)<br>
Tomo stands in place and recovers his Mana gauge

* `22P`<br> **P Renovare** recovers mana with no cost, but at a slow speed. Is very easily counterhit, so Tomo
  should be careful when using it.
* `22K`<br> **K Renovare** recovers mana quickly using meter.

### Glacies Pierce
`214P/K`<br>
Tomo summons a large pillar of ice to interupt the opponent's approach. On contact, freezes the opponent in place.

* `214P`<br> **P Glacies Pierce** 
  Summons a large pillar of ice from the ground that hits the opponent low. Creates a large enough barrier to make it 
  difficult for the opponent to jump over
* `214K`<br> **K Glacies Pierce**
  Summons a large pilar of ice from the sky that hits the opponent high. Is summoned high enough to where it is
  difficult to jump over, and low enough that the opponent needs a good low-profile to respond.
