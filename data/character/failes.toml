during Riptide, he can choose to press %btn(p,P) or %btn(k,K) to exit early and enter recovery. %btn(s,[4]6S) sends
Fail horizontally, while %btn(h,[2]8H) sends him upwards at a steep angle.
<ul>
    <li>%btn(p,P) cancel stops the attack immediately and sends him into a short recovery period.
    <li>%btn(k,K) cancel will cause Fail to jump upwards out of the attack, giving him a strong mixup opportunity.
