Fail throws his trident and hops on, traveling until he hits the opponent or the edge of the screen. At any point
during Riptide, he can choose to press %btn(p,P) or %btn(k,K) to exit early and enter recovery. %btn(s,[4]6S) sends
Fail horizontally, while %btn(h,[2]8H) sends him upwards at a steep angle.

    <li>%btn(p,P) cancel stops the attack immediately and sends him into a short recovery period.</li>
    <li>%btn(k,K) cancel will cause Fail to jump upwards out of the attack, giving him a strong mixup opportunity.</li>

Fail summons 3 tridents that follow him around. The tridents fly towards the opponent one at a time, with small delays
between each launch, giving him safe pressure strings or excellent corner carry. On hit, the opponent is launched
upwards, and on block, the opponent is sent into Guard Crush. In exchange, Fail is in counterhit state for the entire
duration of the move, and the tridents immediately disappear when countered.
