[Character]
Name="Guiblo"
Description="""
Despite his status as a grappler, Guiblo boasts a plethora of tools that help him dominate the match. When utilized
correctly, Guiblo can very easily capitalize on the opponent's whiff for great reward.
<br><br>
Guiblo's strategy mainly revolves around controlling the opponent's position using tools such as
%ref(Gone Fishin',Gone Fishin',k) or his long-range normals. Once Guiblo has secured a position, he can close in
to strike %ref(Heavenly Guiblo Buster,the fear of god,_) into the opponent's hearts, coupled with his oppressive
pressure. Boasting incredible air control, terrifying ground control, and a %ref(Parry,powerful parry,_), it will be
very easy for Guiblo to condition the opponent to act according to his favor.
<br><br>
Guiblo's main weakness is that despite his immovable offense, he doesn't hold much in the way of good defensive options.
He <b>only</b> has command grab supers, both of which can easily be outclassed by a relatively well-placed strike.
Additionally, while his meterless %ref(Huebenly Buster,Huebenly Buster,h) has invulnerability on startup, it won't
serve him well in the face of a regular pressure sequence. Guiblo must instead rely on hard-calling using his backdash
or his parry to steal back his turn.
<br><br>
While he suffers slightly from his imbalanced kit, don't let that cloud your judgementâ€”all Guiblo needs is to land one
good sequence and a beer to thoroughly crush his foe.
