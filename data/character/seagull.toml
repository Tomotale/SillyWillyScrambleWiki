Description="""
Seagull quickly dashes through the air, hitting anything in his path. %btn(p,P) version sends Seagull diagonally
upwards, %btn(s,S) version sends Seagull horizontally, and %btn(h,H) version sends Seagull diagonally downwards.
All versions of Bet hit overhead. Using %btn(s,S) or %btn(h,H) <b>Bet</b> close to the ground combined with the
threat of a possible %ref(Skill,Skill,k) allows Seagull to perform an incredbly ambiguous overhead.

Inputs=["632146H"]

Description="""
An invincible rising reversal that has the ability to loop into itself. Seagull rises up into the air, then divebombs
downwards, taking the opponent with him. If %btn(h,H) is pressed again after the initial divebomb, Seagull will enter
a parry stance that catches strike attacks. If the parry makes contact, Double or Nothing will loop back into itself
and will be able to repeat the sequence until the parry whiffs or until Seagull stops pressing %btn(h,H). If the parry
misses, Seagull will be locked in counter hit recovery for the remainder of the move, giving his opponent a free punish.
