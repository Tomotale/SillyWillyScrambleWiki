Seagull lets out a large scream with a cartoon speech bubble appearing behind him and hitting the opponent from afar.
If used in the air, Seagull retains his previous air momentum.

Description="""
Seagull quickly dashes through the air, hitting anything in his path. %btn(p,P) version sends Seagull diagonally
upwards, %btn(s,S) version sends Seagull horizontally, and %btn(h,H) version sends Seagull diagonally downwards.
All versions of Bet hit overhead. Using %btn(s,S) or %btn(h,H) <b>Bet</b> close to the ground combined with the
threat of a possible %ref(Skill,Skill,k) allows Seagull to perform an incredbly ambiguous overhead.

Description="""
Seagull shoots himself downwards at a steep angle with no hitbox. He can use this move to quickly cross through the
opponent for a scary three-way mixup, or to escape a dire situation with low commitment.
