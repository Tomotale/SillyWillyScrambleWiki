Name="Modern Control Scheme"
Type="Text"
Description="""
Seagull specifically has the option to enable a more modern control scheme that enables simpler inputs for his specials
and supers. As a result, Seagull lacks some command normals that other characters would usually have. Special attacks
are performed by holding a direction and pressing a single button, while supers are performed with a direction
and two buttons pressed simultaneously. Modern Controls can be enabled at the character selection screen by pressing
<b>up</b> with Seagull selected.

Seagull quickly dashes through the air, hitting anything in his path. The %btn(p,P) version sends Seagull diagonally
upwards, the %btn(s,S) version sends Seagull horizontally, and the %btn(h,H) version sends Seagull diagonally downwards.
All versions of Bet hit overhead. Using %btn(s,S) or %btn(h,H) <b>Bet</b> close to the ground combined with the
threat of a possible %ref(Skill,Skill,k) allows Seagull to perform an incredibly ambiguous overhead.

Seagull produces a slow moving fireball that travels in a straight line across the screen. While its slow speed makes it
dangerous up close, it allows for great %note(When your opponent is knocked down and you are able to attack them as soon
as they wake up,okizeme) and helps keep Seagull out of reach from the opponent. During the late recovery of Your, Seagull
can cancel into %ref(Bad,Bad,s).

An invincible rising reversal that has the ability to loop into itself. Seagull rises up into the air, then divebombs
downwards, taking the opponent with him. If %btn(h,H) is pressed again after the initial divebomb, Seagull will enter
a parry stance that catches strike attacks. If the parry makes contact, Double or Nothing will loop back into itself
and will be able to repeat the sequence until the parry whiffs or until Seagull stops pressing %btn(h,H). If the parry
misses, Seagull will be locked in counter hit recovery for the remainder of the move, giving his opponent a free punish.
