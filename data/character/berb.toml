[Character]
Name="Berb"
Description="""
A master of forces beyond this world's comprehension, Berb bends reality itself to disorient and open up his opponent.
<br><br>
Berb possesses a wide range of tools for repositioning himself and his opponent. Placing %ref(Rifts in Time,Rift Points,g)
across the stage using his %ref(Time Rift,Time Rift,p) or %ref(Time Fault,Time Fault,p) allows Berb to teleport himself
back to any of these points using %ref(Chrono Shift,Chrono Shift,k). With well placement of these Points, Berb can
instead use %ref(Distortion,Distortion,s) to keep the opponent in the air or to set up a reset with great mix-up
potential. Expert use of these Points is key to mastering Berb's power.
<br><br>
However, Berb is not only limited to his teleportation abilities. With access to his full-screen hitting super
%ref(Chrono Stasis,Chrono Stasis,k), Berb can freeze time itself, allowing him to lock down the opponent and deliver
devastating follow-ups. If Berb is feeling more extravagant, he can instead use %ref(Accent Acceleration,Accent Acceleration,h)
to speed up the rate of the match <i>and every mechanic timer</i> for him and his opponent—forcing them to play at his
tempo.
<br><br>
Berb remains a nightmare for any match-up, as his grasp over the field forces opponents to respect his every move. A
well-played Berb is unpredictable and oppressive, but poor execution can leave him more vulnerable than most. Having
strong fundamentals and execution is key to unleashing his full potential.

Description="""
Berb can use specific attacks (such as %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Time Fault,2141236P,p)) to create Rift Points
which last until consumed or destroyed. Berb can use these Rift Points to teleport himself using %ref(Chrono Shift,214K,k)
or to juggle the opponent by teleporting them with %ref(Distortion,236S,s). If Berb tries to create
a Rift Point when three are already active, or if he is hit while a Rift is active, the oldest Rift Point will
be destroyed.

With his supers %ref(Chrono Stasis,Chrono Stasis,k) and %ref(Accent Acceleration,Accent Acceleration,h) (and even
his %ref(Taunt,taunt,taunt) to a degree), Berb can manipulate time to lock down or pressure the opponent. Combined
with his incredible agility and his full-screen super, his time manipulation makes for a truly unique and threatening
ability.

Berb summons a new Rift Point at his current position. Setting these points in strategic locations is key to
maximizing his potential, as they can serve as both rewarding offensive tools and reliable escape routes.
Up to three teleport points can be placed at a time. If a fourth point is created, the oldest point will disappear
to make room for the new one.

Berb teleports to the most recent Rift Point. If %btn(k,K) is pressed again during the animation, Berb will instead
move to the next point in line. This can be repeated an additional time to move to the oldest point. Choosing a
different point to teleport to can help trip up opponents who are trying to predict Berb's movement, creating
easy openings for counterattacks.
