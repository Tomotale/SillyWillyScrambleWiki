Name="Berb"
Description="""
Berb controls the stage through strategic placement of Rift Points, to which he can teleport himself or the opponent
to with %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Chrono Shift,214K,k). With his ability to manipulate time and reposition on a
whim, Berd can excellently control the flow of the match (quite literally) to his favor.

Description="""
Berb can use specific attacks (such as %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Time Fault,2141236P,p)) to create Rift Points
that last until consumed or destroyed. Berd can use these Rift Points to teleport himself using %ref(Chrono
Shift,214K,k) or to juggle the opponent by teleporting them with %ref(Distortion,236S,s). If Berd tries to create
a Rift Point when there are already three active, or if he is hit while a Rift is active, the oldest Rift will
be destroyed.

Description="""
With his supers %ref(Chrono Stasis,Chrono Stasis,k) and %ref(Accent Acceleration,Accent Acceleration,h) (and even
his %ref(Taunt,taunt,taunt) to a degree), Berb can manipulate time to lock down or pressure the opponent. Combined
with his incredible agility and his full-screen super, his time manipulation makes for a truly unique and threatening
ability.
