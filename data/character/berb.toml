Name="Berb"
Description="""
Berb controls the stage through the strategic placement of Rift Points, which he can use to teleport himself or the
opponent with %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Chrono Shift,214K,k). With his ability to manipulate time and reposition
on a whim, Berb can expertly control the flow of the match (quite literally) in his favor.

Description="""
Berb can use specific attacks (such as %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Time Fault,2141236P,p)) to create Rift Points
which last until consumed or destroyed. Berb can use these Rift Points to teleport himself using %ref(Chrono Shift,214K,k)
or to juggle the opponent by teleporting them with %ref(Distortion,236S,s). If Berb tries to create
a Rift Point when three are already active, or if he is hit while a Rift is active, the oldest Rift Point will
be destroyed.

Description="""
With his supers %ref(Chrono Stasis,Chrono Stasis,k) and %ref(Accent Acceleration,Accent Acceleration,h) (and even
his %ref(Taunt,taunt,taunt) to a degree), Berb can manipulate time to lock down or pressure the opponent. Combined
with his incredible agility and his full-screen super, his time manipulation makes for a truly unique and threatening
ability.
