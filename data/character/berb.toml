[Character]
Name="Berb"
Description="""
Berb controls the stage through strategic placement of Rift Points, to which he can teleport himself or the opponent
to with %ref(Time Rift,214P,p) or %ref(Chrono Shift,214K,k). With his ability to manipulate time and reposition on a
whim, Berd can excellently control the flow of the match (quite literally) to his favor.
