[Character]
Name="Osi"
Description="""
Osi is a shapeshifting fighter who uses flames to get in close and smoke to disorient the opponent. With powerful mixup
tools, and the ability to impair the opponents vision, clever setup of smoke is essential to playing this character.
With access to Burning Resolve, Osi gains access to high damage combos and fast approaches as well. Make sure to use
this all together to thoroughly beat down your opponent.

# Unique Mechanics
###################################
[[Character.Mechanics]] # Mist
Name="Mist"
Type="Text"
Description="""
Osi's signature mechanic is <b>Mist</b>. Certain moves like  %ref(Smoke Wheel) deploy clouds of Mist,
which Osi can use to obscure himself from the opponent, only showing a faint outline of his form. This makes it much
harder for opponents to see and react to Osi's movements. When Osi is inside the Mist, he takes 50% more damage from
attacks, and if he is hit three times while in the Mist, it will dissipate. Mist, unless created by
%ref(Shrouded in Mist), will also fade after a certain amount of time. While the Mist obscures Osi,
it does not do the same for his visual effects, meaning he should stick to using moves with less pronounced effects
if he wishes to conceal himself effectively.

and instead teleport Osi behind the opponent.

Description="""
The beginning of Osi's rekka. Osi transforms his hand into a flaming blade and slashes forward. This move can be
cancelled into one of three different follow-up attacks by pressing %auto(P), %auto(K), or %auto(S) after the initial
hit connects, allowing him access to a high, low, or an evasive option respectively. Like all moves in his rekka, this
move creates a large amount of visual noise, making it considerably dangerous and less preferable to use inside of Mist
as a mix-up tool.

spins around, raising his scythe high before bringing it down in a wide arc. A rather slow overhead, but a great

sweeping it along the ground. Generally safer and faster than its overhead counterpart, but for less in return.

to hard-punish %ref(Billowing Backoff,236P~S,ps,~).

Osi lets out a powerful burst of smoke that fills the screen. Unlike other moves that deploy Mist, the Mist created
from this move lasts indefinitely until Osi is hit three times. Simultaneously a blessing and a curse, as while Osi can
now move around the screen obscured, the opponent gains more opportunities to hit him while he is in the Mist, taking
advantage of the increased damage he takes while inside it. Likewise, Osi can use this fact as an advantage, baiting
the opponent into using riskier, more committal moves that can be easily punished.
