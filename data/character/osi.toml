[Character]
Name="Osi"
Description="""
Osi is a shapeshifting fighter who uses flames to get in close and smoke to disorient the opponent. With powerful mixup
tools, and the ability to impair the opponents vision, clever setup of smoke is essential to playing this character.
With access to Burning Resolve, Osi gains access to high damage combos and fast approaches as well. Make sure to use
this all together to thoroughly beat down your opponent.

# Unique Mechanics
###################################
[[Character.Mechanics]] # Mist
Name="Mist"
Description="""
Osi's signature mechanic is <b>Mist</b>. Certain moves like  %ref(Smoke Wheel,Smoke Wheel,h) deploy clouds of Mist,
which Osi can use to obscure himself from the opponent, only showing a faint outline of his form. This makes it much
harder for opponents to see and react to Osi's movements. When Osi is inside the Mist, he takes 50% more damage from
attacks, and if he is hit three times while in the Mist, it will dissipate. Mist, unless created by
%ref(Shrouded in Mist,Shrouded in Mist,p), will also fade after a certain amount of time. While the Mist obscures Osi,
it does not do the same for his visual effects, meaning he should stick to using moves with less pronounced effects
if he wishes to conceal himself effectively.
