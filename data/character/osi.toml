[Character]
Name="Osi"
Description="""
Osi is a shapeshifting fighter who uses flames to get in close and smoke to disorient the opponent. With powerful mixup
tools, and the ability to impair the opponents vision, clever setup of smoke is essential to playing this character.
With access to Burning Resolve, Osi gains access to high damage combos and fast approaches as well. Make sure to use
this all together to thoroughly beat down your opponent.

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Mist
Name="Mist"
Description="""
Mist is a field that covers part of the stage. With [insert moves that deploy mist], Osi can deploy the mist around him.
While in the mist, Osi is obscured, with only his faint outline appearing. However, while Osi is in the mist, they take
1.5x damage from attacks, and the mist fades after being hit with a combo of 3, or after some time. Mist takes a bit of
time to take action after being deployed. Osiâ€™s VFX can still be seen from the mist.
