[[Character.Mechanics]] # Exhilaration
Name="Exhilaration"
Description="""
Dani starts the round with 0% <b>Exhilaration Meter</b>. The Exhilaration Meter can be filled by dealing damage to the
opponent. <b>Exhilaration</b> is a state that greatly enhances Dani's movement speed, damage output, and changes her
moveset—making her no longer reliant on her limited resource, %ref(Ammo,Ammo,_). Exhilaration is entered automatically
when the Exhilaration Meter maxes out, or manually by using %ref(Ace,Ace,p). While in Exhilaration, the Exhilaration
Meter decreases over time. If the meter reaches 0% without Dani exiting Exhilaration manually using %ref(Ace,Ace,p),
she will instead be forced out of Exhilaration and into a brief vulnerable period of recovery.
"""

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Ammo
Name="Ammo"
Description="""
Dani's normal state gives her great tools to open up the opponent, but not without its limitations. Dani is limited to
only 8 bullets of %ref(Ammo,Ammo,_), which are consumed by using certain special moves. Once out of ammo, Dani is unable
to use these special moves until she enters Exhilaration, which fully restocks her ammo on exit.
