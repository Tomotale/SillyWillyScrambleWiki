[Character]
Name="Tomo"
Description="""
Wielding a glaive and tome, Tomo is a master of the midrange who uses his resources to control the ebb and flow
of battle.
<br><br>
Tomo is entirely defined by his unique resource, %ref(Mana,Mana,generic). Tomo uses a portion of his Mana to cast
any of his special moves (including %ref(6S,6S,s)). If a move costs more Mana than he currently has, it will not
trigger and instead will whiff. If his Mana is depleted, he will enter %ref(Exhaustion,Exhaustion,generic)—a
debilitating state that leaves him highly vulnerable to massive damage.
<br><br>
Once he is at a safe range, Tomo can use his specials to expertly control the midrange, forcing the opponent to
think twice about their approach. With the right momentum, he can easily keep up a solid web of denial; once
his opponent is caught, Tomo is free to close in for a full combo combined with the choice of %note(When your opponent
is knocked down and you are able to attack them as soon as they wake up,okizeme) or resource recovery. When he has
%ref(Mana Crimen,Mana Crimen,k) and 50% meter on his side, Tomo can skip this choice altogether and opt for a much
longer and more effective pressure sequence which at worst leaves him at neutral odds with the opponent.
<br><br>
Tomo's kit gives him the freedom to decide how the game unfolds, provided he has the resources to do so. In the
right hands, Tomo is a highly versatile and cerebral fighter who rewards patience, precision, and execution.

Name="Mana"
Type="Text"
Description="""
Mana is a resource that Tomo depends on to perform his specials. Upon being hit, he loses Mana proportional
to the amount of damage he takes. He cannot use moves that cost more Mana than he has, requiring him to always
stay on top of his resources. If he is to lose all of his Mana, he enters %ref(Exhaustion,Exhaustion,generic).

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Exhaustion
Name="Exhaustion"
Type="Text"
Description="""
When Tomo's Mana is exhausted, he automatically enters Exhaustion. During this state, Tomo is left <b>helpless
and vulnerable</b>—he cannot input any commands, takes <b>twice</b> as much damage as normal, and the following hit
triggers an <b>automatic counter hit</b>. Exhaustion lasts until a couple seconds have passed or until the
current combo ends. At the end of this state, Tomo recovers with 100% Mana, and is able to restart his
offense.

# TODO: Reflectable projectiles list
Description="""
Tomo uses his tome to summon a large wall of magic covering a wide area in front of him.
<br><br>
This move serves as both a good spacing tool and an even better anti-zoning tool, reflecting any incoming projectiles
back from whence they came. Being a command normal, this move can be canceled into any of Tomo's powerful special
moves or supers. Additionally, this move can be canceled into itself on hit for easy extra damage in the corner.
<br><br>
Overall, its low Mana cost and wide array of follow-up options being available both on block and on hit solidifies this
move as a reliable option as a non-committal 'get-off-me' tool whenever Tomo is low on Mana or needs to escape a less
than favorable position.

Tomo covers a large amount of space with ice, interrupting the opponent's approach. On hit, freezes the opponent in
place until a set amount of time passes or immediately upon the next hit.
<ul>
    <li>In %btn(p,P) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo slams the ground in front of him, sprouting a large pillar of ice
    that hits the opponent low. Creates a large enough barrier to make it difficult for the opponent to jump over.</li>
    <li>In %btn(k,K) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo rides into the air, summoning a trail of ice underneath him that hits
    the opponent high. On air hit, the opponent is frozen until they reach the ground, taking additional damage and
    causing a ground bounce. The ice trail is summoned high enough to where it is difficult to jump over, and low
    enough that the opponent needs to use a good low-profile option to respond.</li>
</ul>
Boasting its large space control and relatively low mana cost, Glacies Pierce is a formidable move that demands respect
in neutral, making it simultaneously one of Tomo's safest options to set up %ref(Renovare,Renovare,generic) and a great
option for setting up damage using a fully charged %ref(Ignis Rush,Ignis Rush,generic).
