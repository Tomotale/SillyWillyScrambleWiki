[[Character.Mechanics]] # Mana
Name="Mana"
Description="""
Mana is a resource that Tomo depends on to perform his specials. Upon being hit, he loses Mana equal proportionate
to the amount of damage he takes. He cannot use moves that cost more Mana than he has, requiring him to always
stay on top of his resource. If he is to lose all of his Mana, he enters %ref(Exhaustion,Exhaustion,generic).
"""

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Exhaustion
Name="Exhaustion"
Description="""
When Tomo's mana is exhausted, he automatically enters Exhaustion. During this state, Tomo is left <b>helpless
and vulnerable</b>â€”he cannot input any commands, he takes <b>twice</b> as much damage as normal, and the following hit
triggers an <b>automatic counter hit</b>. Exhaustion lasts until a couple seconds have passed or until the
current combo ends. At the end of this state, Tomo recovers with 100% Mana, and is able to restart his
offense.

Tomo uses his tome to quickly summon a wall of magic that not only reflects any incoming projectiles. In addition to
its strong defensive capabilities, this move can be cancelled into itself on hit, rewarding Tomo with easy damage in
corner combos.

Name="Ignis Rush"
Inputs=["236S", "H"]
HoldOK=true

Buttons=["s", "h"]
Condition="with 20% Mana"
Image=""
Description="""
A chargable fire-based projectile that travels along a set path, exploding into a firery vortex which launches the
opponent up into the air after a few hits. Charging <b>Ignis Rush</b> increases the amount of distance the projectile
can travel before exploding or disappearing.
<ul>
    <li>%btn(s,S) <b>Ignis Rush</b> creates a projectile that travels along the ground. When performed in the air,
    the projectile maintains its usual horizontal trajectory. The explosion triggers after a certain amount of distance
     or upon hitting the opponent.</li>
    <li>%btn(h,H) <b>Ignis Rush</b> creates a projectile that travels diagonally up into the air. When performed in
     the air, the projectile travels diagonally downwards. The explosion no longer triggers automatically, only
     activating when it hits the opponent.</li>

Tomo summons blades of wind that can be used to push the opponent.
<ul>
    <li>In %btn(s,S) <b>Ventus Thrust</b>, Tomo summons blades of wind from the opposite side of the screen, pushing
    the opponent towards himself. Can catch opponents who have a habit of backdashing. Pressing %btn(s,S) again makes
    Tomo perform a forward thrust with his spear, sending the opponent into the winds.</li>
    <li>In %btn(h,H) <b>Ventus Thrust</b>, Tomo uses his wind to propel himself and stab into the oppponent.
    Pressing %btn(h,H) again halts his movement to float upwards, shortly before diving into the ground and hitting
    the opponent high.</li>

Description="""
Tomo stands in place and recovers his Mana gauge
<ul>
    <li>%btn(p,P) <b>Renovare</b> recovers mana with no cost, but at a slow speed. Is very easily counterhit, so Tomo
    should be very careful when using it. This version is almost always overshadowed by %btn(k,22K) unless
    Tomo has secured a safe position to use it in.</li>
    <li>%btn(k,K) <b>Renovare</b> recovers mana quickly at the cost of meter. This version is much safer to use in
    neutral, but is still requires a similar caution to its %btn(p,P) counterpart, as Tomo will gradually lose
    more meter over time.</li>

[[Character.Specials]] # Glacies Pierce
Name="Glacies Pierce"
Inputs=["214P", "K"]
Buttons=["p", "k"]
Condition="with 15% Mana"
Image=""
Description="""
Tomo covers a large amount of space with ice, interrupting the opponent's approach. On hit, freezes the opponent in
place until a set amount of time passes or immediately upon the next hit.
<ul>
    <li>In %btn(p,P) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo slams the ground in front of him, sprouting a large pillar of ice
    that hits the opponent low. Creates a large enough barrier to make it difficult for the opponent to jump over.</li>
    <li>In %btn(k,K) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo rides into the air, summoning a trail of ice underneath him that hits
    the opponent high. On air hit, the opponent is frozen until they reach the ground, taking additional damage and
    causing a ground bounce. The ice trail is summoned high enough to where it is difficult to jump over, and low
    enough that the opponent needs to use a good low-profile option to respond.</li>
</ul>
Boasting its large space control and relatively low mana cost, Glacies Pierce is a formidable move that demands respect
in neutral, making it simultaneously one of Tomo's safest options to set up %ref(Renovare,Renovare,generic) and a great
option for setting up damage using a fully charged %ref(Ignis Rush,Ignis Rush,generic).
