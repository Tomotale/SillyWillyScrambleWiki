# Unique Mechanics

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Mana
Name="Mana"
Description="""
Mana is a resource that Tomo spends to perform his specials. Upon being hit, he loses Mana equal to the HP
damage that he takes. He cannot use specials that cost more Mana then he has. Upon hitting 0 Mana, enter
Stagger state, then regain all Mana.
"""

[[Character.Mechanics]] # Stagger State
Name="Stagger State"
Description="""
When Tomo's mana is exhausted, he automatically enters Stagger State. During this state, Tomo is left <b>helpless
and vulnerable</b>â€”he cannot input any commands, he takes <b>twice</b> as much damage as normal, and the following hit
triggers an <b>automatic counter hit</b>. Stagger State until a couple seconds have passed or the end of the current
combo.

Condition="with 5% Mana"

Tomo uses his tome to quickly summon a wall of magic that not only reflects any incoming projectiles. In addition to
its strong defensive capabilities, this move can be cancelled into itself on hit, rewarding Tomo with easy damage in
corner combos.

Description="""
A chargable fire-based projectile that travels along a set path, exploding into a firery vortex which launches the
opponent up into the air.
<ul>
    <li>%btn(s,S) <b>Ignis Rush</b> creates a projectile that travels along the ground. The explosion triggers after
    a certain amount of distance or upon hitting the opponent.</li>

Description="""
Tomo summons blades of wind that can be used to push the opponent.
<ul>
    <li>%btn(s,S) <b>Ventus Thrust</b> summons blades of wind from the opposite side of the screen, pushing the
    opponent towards Tomo. Can catch opponents who have a habit of backdashing. Pressing %btn(s,S) again makes Tomo
    perform a forward thrust with his spear, sending the opponent into the winds.</li>
    <li>%btn(h,H) <b>Ventus Thrust</b> summons blades directly in front of Tomo, sending the opponent away. Pressing
    %btn(h,H) again causes the blades to switch direction and move diagonally.</li>

Name="Renovare"
Inputs=["22P", "K"]
Buttons=["p", "k"]
Image=""
Description="""
Tomo stands in place and recovers his Mana gauge
<ul>
    <li>%btn(p,P) <b>Renovare</b> recovers mana with no cost, but at a slow speed. Is very easily counterhit, so Tomo
    should be very careful when using it.</li>
    <li>%btn(k,K) <b>Renovare</b> recovers mana quickly at the cost of meter.</li>

"""

[[Character.Specials]] # Glacies Pierce
Name="Glacies Pierce"
Inputs=["214P", "K"]
Buttons=["p", "k"]
Condition="with 15% Mana"
Image=""
Description="""
Tomo covers a large amount of space with ice, interrupting the opponent's approach. On hit, freezes the opponent in
place until a set amount of time passes or immediately upon the next hit.
<ul>
    <li>In %btn(p,P) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo slams the ground in front of him, sprouting a large pillar of ice
    that hits the opponent low. Creates a large enough barrier to make it difficult for the opponent to jump over.</li>
    <li>In %btn(k,K) <b>Glacies Pierce</b>, Tomo rides into the air, summoning a trail of ice underneath him that hits
    the opponent high. On air hit, the opponent is frozen until they reach the ground, taking additional damage and
    causing a ground bounce. The ice trail is summoned high enough to where it is difficult to jump over, and low
    enough that the opponent needs to use a good low-profile option to respond.</li>
</ul>
Boasting its large space control and relatively low mana cost, Glacies Pierce is a formidable move that demands respect
in neutral, making it simultaneously one of Tomo's safest options to set up %ref(Renovare,Renovare,generic) and a great
option for setting up damage using a fully charged %ref(Ignis Rush,Ignis Rush,generic).
