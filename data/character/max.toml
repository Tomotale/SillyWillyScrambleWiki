[Character]
Name="Max"
Description="""
Running entirely off of coffee, Max is a patient character, taking great advantage of opponents who may be asleep at the
wheel.
<br><br>
Max's premier mechanic is their Caffeine Gauge, giving them access to enhanced versions of their special moves.
While the Caffeine Gauge serves as a powerful tool for Max, it doesn't come for free. Max must use %ref(Energizzze,22K,k)
to recharge their levels, often having to give up powerful %note(When your opponent is knocked down and you are able to
attack them as soon as they wake up,okizeme) to keep their momentum going.
<br><br>
Once fueled up, Max's combo game becomes much more potent and versatile, scoring massive corner carry off of small
hits. With a great overhead in %ref(Anvil Mantle,en.214H,h) and the threat of %ref(Sweater Weather,623H,h)'s range and
launch, Max has plenty of opportunities to open up the opponent and take them wherever they please.
<br><br>
Without Caffeine on their side, Max's moves are still nothing to scoff about—they still serve good utility when used
correctly. Most of their moves still allow them ample time to route into a knockdown and recharge their gauge. In
exchange for their great offense, Max lacks a meterless reversal, making it more difficult to escape pressure. Max will
need to play passively until they can find a moment to strike.
<br><br>
Max excels at keeping their opponent exactly where they want when they have Caffeine on their side, greatly rewarding
those who can keep up with their resource management.

Name="Caffeine Gauge"
Type="Text"
Description="""
Max uses their Caffeine Gauge to perform enhanced versions of their special moves. Max starts the round with 0 out of
3 Caffeine bars, and one is consumed every time a special move is performed. Max's moves when enhanced are significantly
more powerful, deal more damage, and have more launch power, allowing for more combo potential when managed correctly.
