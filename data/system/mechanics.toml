[[System.BasicMovement]] # Walking
Type="Text"
Name="Walking"
Description="""
<code>[4] or [6] while grounded</code><br>
Walking is the most basic form of movement in the game. By holding or tapping the direction, the character will
continuously move in that direction based off their movement speed multiplier. Walking cannot be performed using
diagonal inputs. Walking backwards while being attacked will automatically cancel into a block.
"""

[[System.BasicMovement]] # Running and Dashing
Type="Text"
Name="Running and Dashing"
Description="""
<code>6[6] or 6+Dash Macro</code><br>
Running is a much faster form of with a few more drawbacks than simply walking. The first input of a run (if not using
the Dash Macro) must be a 6 direction, after which any forwards direction will suffice. After releasing a run without
directly cancelling into another move, the character will skid for a short time unless stopped with any backwards input.
Characters can block during a skid, but they will not be able to walk until the skid is ended.
<ul>
    <li>The 6 input is not required when using the Dash Macro</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Some characters won't have a run and instead will have a step-dash. A Step-dash is performed the same as a run, but
it cannot be held and must travel its full distance until stopping. This makes moving forwards a riskier option, as
the character will not have full freedom to stop or change direction. Characters with step-dashes usually have other
specialized movement options to make up for this.
"""

[[System.BasicMovement]] # Backdash
Type="Text"
Name="Backdash"
Description="""
<code>44 or 4+Dash Macro</code><br>
Backdashing is a form of movement that allows the character to move backwards at a much faster speed than walking. The
first input of a backdash (if not using the Backdash Macro) must be a 4 direction, after which any backwards direction
will suffice. Backdashes cannot be performed using diagonal inputs. Backdashes can be cancelled into any move, but
characters will not be able to walk until the backdash is ended.
<ul>
    <li>Backdashing has a short window of invulnerability on startup, allowing it to be used as a "reversal" against
    some meaty options.</li>
    <li>When backdashing, your character is forced into an airborne state. This means that when getting hit during a
    backdash, your character will already be in the air, giving your opponent high-power combo opportunities when
    misused.</li>
</ul>
"""

[[System.AerialMovement]]
Type="Summary"
Name="Aerial Movement"
Description="""
Aerial movement, unlike grounded movement is much more restricted. Each character has a set amount of air actions,
representing the amount of times they can perform a jump or airdash. Most characters come with only one air action
available when in the air. Some characters have additional air actions, allowing them to perform multiple jumps or
airdashes.
"""

[[System.AerialMovement]] # Prejump
Type="Text"
Name="Prejump"
Description="""
Jumps have their own startup frames and landing recovery frames. Before entering the air, characters will stand in place
for a short amount of time. This prejump period gives them full throw invincibility. Unlike backdashing, characters
hit during prejump will not be sent airborne and will still need to be launched manually.
<br><br>
Prejump frames can be cancelled at any point into specials or supers. This allows players to easily perform inputs
that require an upwards direction, or to perform an air attack using a Tiger Knee motion. For example,
%refOther(Seagull, Skill, "Seagull\\'s", Skill, K) can be performed at the earliest possible moment during or after
prejump by inputting %auto(2369K).
"""

[[System.AerialMovement]] # Jumping
Type="Text"
Name="Jumping"
Description="""
<code>Any upwards direction (Air OK)</code><br>
Jumping allows the character to move in the air. Air movement, unlike grounded movement, cannot be controlled as freely.
Based on the input used to perform the jump (7, 8, 9), the character will move in a backwards (7), neutral (8), or
forwards (9) direction.
"""

[[System.AerialMovement]] # Airdash
Type="Text"
Name="Airdash"
Description="""
<code>j.44/66</code> or <code>j.4/6+Dash Macro</code><br>
Airdashing is a powerful movement option when in the air. Airdashes can be cancelled into any move except for blocking.
Cancelling an airdash into a move (that does not halt air momentum) retains the character's air momemtum, allowing for
easy screen travel depending on the move.
"""

# todo: Landing recovery


[[System.Grab]]
Type="Description"
Description="""
<code>??? (Air OK)</code><br>
Universal proximity unblockable move. Grabs guarantee hard knockdown on success, but are in counter hit state for the
entire duration. The attacker’s airborne state must match the defender’s when trying to land a grab. Grabs can be
teched by also pressing grab within a short time period (10f?).
<ul>
    <li>Grabs have higher priority than strike attacks when clashing</li>
    <li>Command Grabs, a unique type of grab, cannot be teched</li>
    <li>Air Grab teching has significantly less recovery than ground teching</li>
</ul>

[[System.Burst]]
Type="Description"
Description="""
<code>??? (Air OK) with 100% Burst Gauge</code><br>
"""

[[System.ScrambleCancel]]
Type="Description"
Description="""
<code>??? (Air OK) with 25~50% meter</code><br>
costs 25% on hit, 50% on whiff
"""

[[System.Cancels]]
Type="Description"
Description="""
<h4>Gatling</h4>
Most normal attacks can cancel into normals on hit or block. Gatlings will typically follow the order %auto(P > K > S > H).
Some normals may follow different gatling rules such as %btn("5P, 2P, 6P",ppp,",") and %auto("j.P"), which can all
self-gatling infinitely.
<br><br>

<h4>Special Cancel</h4>
Most normals are special and super cancellable during their active and recovery periods.
<br><br>

<h4>Jump Cancel</h4>
Specific attacks can be cancelled into a jump (WHO), provided the character is grounded or has enough air options to do
so. Additionally, prejump frames can be special cancelled, enabling the use of Tiger Knee inputs.
<br><br>

<h4>Dash Cancel</h4>
Specific attacks can be cancelled into a dash or airdash (WHOOV)
<br><br>

<h4>Scramble Cancel</h4>
See the %ref(Scramble Cancel,Scramble Cancel,_) section for more information.
<br><br>

<h4>Kara Cancel</h4>
Normals and dash cancels can be kara cancelled into specials or supers during their first 3 startup frames. Special
moves can be kara cancelled into supers during their first 3 startup frames. Additionally, some attacks may also have
specialized kara cancel windows with unique properties.
<br><br>

<h4>Strike Clash</h4>
When two hitboxes intersect without making contact with the opponent’s hurtbox, they cancel out into a Clash. Clashes
can immediately be cancelled into any attack, jump (if the clashing move is jump cancellable and if in the air, the
character has enough air actions to do so), and forward runs/dashes.
<br><br>

<h4>Projectile Clash</h4>
When two projectile-owned hitboxes intersect with eachother and neither reaches an enemy hurtbox, they create a Clash.
Each projectile has a level attribute that determines their clash behavior. Projectiles with a higher level will
instantly destroy those with lower levels. If two projectiles have the same level, then the projectile will consume
hits until either or none survive.
<br><br>

<h4>Projectile Reflection</h4>
When a reflectable projectile hits a reflecting hitbox (regardless if that projectile successfully connected with a
hurtbox or not), its reflection state activates. Most reflectable projectiles will simply reverse the other way, but
others may have special behavior.
