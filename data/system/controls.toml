Silly Willy Scramble uses a simple control scheme with 4 buttons and several utility macros to perform a variety of
actions. The names of these buttons take after the Guilty Gear series.

Name="Button Layout"
Description="""
<ul>
    <li>%auto(P) - Punch - Your lightest normal attack button. Typically useful to get out of pressure with low
    commitment, or stopping the opponent's approach with the universal %auto(6P) anti-air.</li>
    <li>%auto(K) - Kick - Your second lightest normal button. This button is sometimes linked to motion inputs that
    deal with special movement options.</li>
    <li>%auto(S) - Slash - Your best button for a balance of power and versatility.</li>
    <li>%auto(H) - Heavy Slash - In most cases, your most powerful button. Will usually come at a cost of being sluggish
    or high commitment, but the rewards are well worth it when used correctly.</li>
</ul>

[[System.Macros]]
Type="Text"
Name="Macros"
Description="""
<ul>
    <li>Dash - Allows you to run up or dash without having to manually press %btn(66,x). Additionally, you can input
    other directions or motions significantly easier, as the 6 direction is not occupied when using the macro.
    Backdash can be performed by inputting 4+Dash Macro, although it cannot be held.</li>
    <li>Burst - Performs a Burst at the press of a button. </li>
    <li>Scramble Cancel - One button Scramble Cancel macro.</li>
    <li>Taunt - </li>
</ul>
"""
#    While the input for Burst is relatively simple, it is
#    useful if you have a controller layout that does not allow you to press the buttons as comfortably.
